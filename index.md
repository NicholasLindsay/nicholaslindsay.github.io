I am a Ph. D. candidate in the [Yale CS Department](https://engineering.yale.edu/academic-study/departments/computer-science) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I am advised by [Professor Abhishek Bhattacharjee](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/abhishek-bhattacharjee).

My research focuses on microarchitecture and formal methods, with an emphasis on the hardware-software interface.
I have developed software tools which increase the interpretibility of hardware event counters for architects, software developers, and researchers.
I have used these tools to decipher undocumented and ambiguously documented features in a CPU microarchitecture.
