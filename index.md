I am a Ph. D. candidate in the [Yale CS Department](https://engineering.yale.edu/academic-study/departments/computer-science) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I am advised by [Professor Abhishek Bhattacharjee](https://engineering.yale.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-directory/abhishek-bhattacharjee).
On August 1st, 2026 I will be joining [AMD Research](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html).

My research focuses on microarchitecture and formal methods, with an emphasis on the hardware-software interface.

I have developed **CounterPoint** - a modeling framework that helps users reconcile their
microarchitectural models with the underlying hardware.
Using **[CounterPoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01265)**, I have found evidence for a
number of undocumented and underdocumented features for the memory management unit of
Intel Haswell CPUs, including a TLB prefetcher, early paging-structure cache lookup, and
mergable page table walks.
